- To compute a new Solar Wind speed map from polarized Brightness (pB) and UltraViolet (UV) images open "Metis_from_pB_and_UV_to_Wind_Speed.ipynb"
- To download pB and UV images from the Solar Orbiter ARchive (SOAR) open "SOAR_downloader.ipynb"
- To compare the Solar Wind speed maps calculated through this code with maps (.fits) from another code open "Validation/DDT_test_&_validation.ipynb" 

In any case, feel free to contact me If you need to use this software: dario.vetrano@studenti.polito.it
I will be happy to discuss it with you and to point out its strengths and its current limitations :)
